# Student Grade Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Grade Calculator is a console-based Python application developed as part of Week 2 (Control Flow & Data Structures).

The application processes multiple students' marks, calculates grades using conditional logic, provides personalized comments, computes class statistics, and allows additional operations such as search and saving results to a file.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of conditionals, loops, lists, functions, error handling, and file operations.
